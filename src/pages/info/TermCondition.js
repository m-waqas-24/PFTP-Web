                                        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and

                                        <p>You and PFTP are dealing at arms’ length, creating a commercial relationship. PFTP is not your Agent or
                                        your fiduciary. Many of PFTP’s businesses and facilities may be independently owned and operated by
                                        independent franchisees and licensees. In such cases, these franchisees and licensees manage and
                                        operate the facilities, and they are the employers of all employees and contractors who work at the
                                        facilities. These franchisees are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture,
                                        employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by these Terms.</p>

                                        entire Agreement between PFTP (including the Providers), its affiliated or related entities, and You, and
                                        supersede any prior agreements or understandings not incorporated herein. In the event that any
